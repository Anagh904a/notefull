Notefull

The pre-release version of Notefull is now live! 🚀
Other repositories like Notes and similar experimental projects are all dedicated to supporting and evolving this main project.

I’m beyond thrilled to share that the final project is already more than 50% complete. Development is moving at a steady pace, and this is just the beginning of something bigger.

👉 Stay tuned for more updates — the best is yet to come!
